&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Additional California Privacy Disclosures - Notice</h2>

<p>This portion of the Privacy and Cookies Policy applies solely to California Consumers (&ldquo;consumers&rdquo; or &ldquo;you&rdquo;). We have adopted this Notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;) and other California privacy laws.&nbsp; The purpose of this Notice is to provide you with a description of our online and offline practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of personal information and of the rights you have regarding your personal information. As used in this Notice, any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Notice.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Shine the Light</strong></p>

<p>Pursuant to Section 1798.83-.84 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, what types of personal information, if any, the business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information in the immediately preceding calendar year. To access this information, please contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:Marketing@TQL.com">Marketing@TQL.com</a> with &ldquo;CA Shine the Light Privacy Requests&rdquo; in the subject line. Please note that, under the law, we are not required to respond to your request more than once in a calendar year, nor are we required to respond to any requests that are not sent to the above-designated email.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (&ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;)</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><strong><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<u>Your Right to Know About the Personal Information We Collect About You</u></em></strong></p>

<p>We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device (&ldquo;personal information&rdquo;). The Sections above titled &ldquo;<strong>Information Collected</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>TQL&rsquo;s Use of Information Collected</strong>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;<strong>TQL&rsquo;s Sharing of Information</strong>&rdquo; which set forth the categories of personal information that we collect and process about you, a description of each category, and the source of how we obtain each category.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em><u>Your Rights and Choices</u></em></strong></p>

<p>Under California Laws, California residents can exercise three privacy rights (Disclosure and Access; Deletion; and &ldquo;Do Not Sell My Personal Information&rdquo;) (collectively, &ldquo;Rights&rdquo;); however, based on the information we gather, and the fact that we do not &ldquo;sell&rdquo; personal information as that term is defined in the CCPA, your rights are somewhat limited as these Rights are not absolute and are subject to certain exceptions. For instance, we are not required to respond to requests concerning employment/application data, B2B data, and cannot disclose or permit access to specific pieces of personal information if the disclosure or access would present a certain level of risk to the security of the personal information, your account with us, or the security of the business&rsquo;s systems of networks. Specifically, employment/application data is not subject to this Notice if it is personal information that is collected by us in the course of your acting as a job applicant, employee, owner, director, officer, medical staff member, or contractor to us to the extent your personal information is collected and used by us solely within the context of your role or former role as a job applicant to, employee of, owner of, director of, officer of, medical staff member of, or a contractor of ours. This also extends to any emergency contact information or benefits administration information you may have provided us in this context. B2B data is similarly not subject to this Notice if the data reflects a written or verbal communication or transaction between you and us if you are acting as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, nonprofit, or government agency and whose communications or transaction with us occurs solely in the context of us conducting due diligence regarding, or providing or receiving a product or service to or from such company, partnership, sole proprietorship, nonprofit or government agency. If you are a California consumer, we will process your request to exercise your Rights in accordance with California Laws.</p>

<p>A record concerning the requests may be maintained pursuant to our legal obligations. Further, we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on a request if such request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em><u>Disclosure and Access Requests </u></em></strong></p>

<p>You have the right to request that we disclose to you, for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of your request to know the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>Categories of Personal Information Request</u></em></p>

<ul>
	<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
	<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
	<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
	<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
	<li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
		<li>sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</li>
		<li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>Specific Pieces of Information Request</u></em></p>

<ul>
	<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
</ul>

<p>When a request for disclosure is made, we will first take steps to verify your identity to protect your privacy and security. For requests to disclose categories of personal information collected, we will have the requestor provide at least two pieces of information so that we may verify the requestor&rsquo;s identity to a reasonable degree of certainty. For requests to disclose specific pieces of personal information collected, we will have the requestor provider at least three pieces of information so that we may verify the requestor&rsquo;s identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty and additionally provide a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. We are required to retain&nbsp; the signed declarations as part of our record-keeping obligations for 24 months.</p>

<p>Please note that we will never disclose a consumer&rsquo;s social security number, driver&rsquo;s license number, or other government-issued identification number, financial account number, any health information or medical identification number, an account password, or security questions and answers in response to a disclosure request.</p>

<p>Please note additionally that we are only required to fulfil a Disclosure request from a consumer twice per every 12-month period. If you submit a request in excess, it may be denied or you may be charged for fulfilling your request.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em><u>Deletion Request Rights</u></em></strong></p>

<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Given the type of personal information we collect, for requests to delete personal information collected, we will have the requestor provide at least two pieces of information so that we may verify the requestor&rsquo;s identity to a reasonable degree of certainty. We are required to retain the requests to delete for a period of 12 months as part of our record-keeping obligations.</p>

<p>If we are unable to verify a request, to the extent possible, that request will be treated as a request to opt-out and afforded rights associated with that request right as described in more detail below.</p>

<p>Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. A deletion request may be denied, in full or in part, if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
	<li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
	<li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
	<li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
	<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1546&nbsp;<em>seq.</em>).</li>
	<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information&#39;s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research&#39;s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
	<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
	<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
	<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em><u>Exercising Disclosure and Deletion Rights</u></em></strong></p>

<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Emailing us at <a href="mailto:Marketing@TQL.com">Marketing@TQL.com</a> with &ldquo;Deletion Request&rdquo; in the subject line</li>
	<li>Visit us at <a href="contact.html">https://www.rename.com/contact</a> and at the top of the Message state &ldquo;Deletion Request&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Only you may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>

<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
	<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.&nbsp; Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.&nbsp; We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor&#39;s identity or authority to make the request and, to the extent necessary, to identify the browser/device that is the subject of the request.</p>

<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.&nbsp; If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.&nbsp; If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.&nbsp; If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response electronically.&nbsp; Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request&#39;s receipt.&nbsp; The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.&nbsp; For data disclosure requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>

<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.&nbsp; If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em><u>Household Requests</u></em></strong></p>

<p>We currently do not collect household data. If all the members of a household makes a Right to Know or Right to Delete request, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em><u>Request Made Through Agents</u></em></strong></p>

<p>You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, verify the agents identity, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us. (The verification requirement does not apply if the consumer has provided the authorized agent with legal power of attorney under California Probate Code Sections 400 to 4465.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em><u>Requests to Opt-In for Minors</u></em></strong></p>

<p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us not to sell your personal information at any time. We do not and will not sell personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age unless we received affirmative authorization from the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age, to opt-in to the sale of their personal information. Upon the receipt of this request to opt-in, we will inform the minor of the right to opt-out later and of the process for doing so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em><u>Sale and Disclosure of Personal Information</u></em></strong></p>

<p>Under the CCPA, a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; means providing to a third party personal information for valuable consideration. It does not necessarily mean money was exchanged for the transfer of personal information. We have taken substantial steps to identify whether any of our data sharing arrangements would constitute a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; under the CCPA. Due to the complexities and ambiguities in the CCPA, we will continue to evaluate some of our third party relationships as we wait for final implementing regulations and guidance. For example, it is currently unclear whether the use of certain types of advertising partners would be considered a sale under CCPA. <strong>Based on our understanding of the CCPA at this time, in the preceding 12 months we have not sold any personal information to any third parties.</strong> <strong>In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed personal information to third parties for business purposes including to customer service, technical support, payment processors, information technology, and sales, recruiting and marketing partners.</strong> We will continue to update our business practices as regulatory guidance becomes available and provides clarity on what constitutes a sale transaction, particularly in the advertising ecosystem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em><u>Non-Discrimination</u></em></strong></p>

<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
	<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
	<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
	<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies: </strong>These are required for the operation of the TQL Sites. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas. These cookies are session cookies that are erased when you close your browser.</p>

<p><strong>Analytical/Performance Cookies:</strong> These allow us to recognize and count the number of users of the TQL Sites and understand how such users navigate through the TQL Sites. This helps to improve how the TQL Sites work, for example, by ensuring that users can find what they are looking for easily. These cookies are session cookies which are erased when you close your browser.&nbsp; We use Google Analytics, and you can see below for how to control the use of cookies by Google Analytics.</p>

<p><strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> These improve the functional performance of the TQL Sites and make it easier for you to use them. For example, cookies are used to remember that you have previously visited the TQL Sites and asked to remain logged into them. These cookies qualify as persistent cookies, because they remain on your device for us to use during a next visit to the TQL Sites.&nbsp; You can delete these cookies via your browser settings.</p>

<p><strong>Targeting Cookies:</strong> These record your visit to the TQL Sites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to recognize you as a previous visitor and to track your activity on the TQL Sites and other websites you visit. These cookies qualify as persistent cookies, because they remain on your device for us to use during a next visit to the TQL Sites. You can delete these cookies via your browser settings. See below for further details on how you can control third party targeting cookies.</p>

<h2>Cookies Used on TQL Sites</h2>

<p>The following tables lists the cookies potentially in use on the TQL Sites.&nbsp; We will update this table as the TQL Sites change.</p>
